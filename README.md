# lcs
This program calculates the Lowest Common Substring of two strings (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_substring_problem)

### Instructions
Download the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/jtharris-dev/lcs.git
```

Compile and run the program in any Java IDE

### Using the Program
When you run the program, it will ask you to enter two files. Use the included example files, edit them, or use your own. The file should be a .txt file with a single string on the first line. One you've entered the two filenames, the program will calculate the lowest common substring of the two strings and output that string, along with the %match (1 means the strings are identical, 0 means the strings have no common letters).
